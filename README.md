# Quickstart Scripts for a fleet of Raspberry Pi's
Library of scripts (cloud-init, ansible) to facilitate quick starts for local development and testing.

Organized by project/use-case, all meant to be used with the fantastic Hypriot OS (as alot of what I do involves containers somehow) and with cloud-init and the proper kernel features (`cgroup_*`) enabled by default.. can't recommend it enough!
